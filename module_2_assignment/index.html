      <h2 id="past">Past</h2>
      <p>The past is where it all began. It carries the stories, lessons, and experiences that shaped the path ahead. Every success and failure added to the foundation, building the strength and wisdom to move forward. It reminds us of where we came from, the people who influenced us, and the struggles that taught us resilience. Though it cannot be changed, it serves as a compass, guiding us with the wisdom of experience.</p>

    <section id="s2">
      <h2 id="present">Present</h2>
      <p>The present is where life truly happens. It is about living, learning, and making choices that define the journey. This moment is a bridge between what has been and what is yet to come â€” a chance to create meaning today. It is the space where dreams are acted upon, where small decisions ripple into greater change. The present teaches us the value of mindfulness, urging us to embrace each second fully, for it is the only time we truly hold in our hands.</p>

    <section id="s3">
      <h2 id="future">Future</h2>
      <p>The future is unwritten, filled with possibilities and dreams waiting to be realized. It represents hope, growth, and the vision of a better tomorrow. What we choose today becomes the foundation of the future we build. It is a canvas of endless opportunity, shaped by courage, persistence, and imagination. Though uncertain, it is also inspiring, reminding us that every step forward is a chance to create the life we aspire to live.</p>
